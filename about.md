# National role

Data and Citizen Science
At VMDC the engagement of citizens in research activities (“citizen science”) is fostered through projects that motivate locals (as well as visitors) to participate in data collection. An example is the Coast Snap Project where citizens collect data on coastal change by taking pictures of the beach at designated stations along the Belgian coast. Always taken from the same position (cellphone holder), these pictures provide time series data for the analysis of shifting shorelines and beach-dune dynamic (e.g. erosion and accretion).

Something about VMDC and accreditatie?
The Flanders Marine Data Centre (VMDC) provides assistance, technologies and tools to scientists and policymakers to support marine data management. Within international networks VLIZ participates in supporting data infrastructures and promoting the flow of marine data from Belgium.
